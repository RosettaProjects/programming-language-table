# Python

## 0. Information, Help, etc.

Main site: python.org

### 0.0 Current versions at the time of writing

3.9 - 3.13

### 0.1 Short language profile

High-level, general-purpose, interpreted, dynamically and strongly typed with optional type annotations and third-party libraries for type checking. Has a large standard library and describes itself as "batteries included".
Extensive support for imperative and object-oriented paradigms, with a number of features supporting functional programming.

### 0.1.0 Most salient features

Blocks defined by indentation, rather than curly braces as in most C-inspired languages. Especially good support for strings and regular expressions. Convenient high-level data structures, such as lists, tuples, and dictionaries.

### 0.4 Ecosystem and community

Python has a large and vibrant community, with a large number of packages written. Some of these packages are even still actively maintained.

#### 0.4.0 Notable standard libraries


#### 0.4.1 Recommended libraries



### 0.5 Valid praise

Python's standard library offers a huge and thoroughly-tested 

### 0.6 Valid criticisms

The first and most conspicuous flaw is the relative of difficulty of installing and managing dependencies, compared to similar high-level languages. Some libraries mitigate this, but compared to the silky-smooth syntax of the language itself, getting set up with a good Python environment on your machine is a surprisingly bumpy experience for beginners.

Not suitable for low-level progrmming where performance is of the essence. May lead to laziness when it is the first and only programming language, because it insulates programmers from the "bare metal" aspects of programming, especially compared to low-level (albeit technically still high-level) languages like Fortran, C, C++, Zig, etc.

Some people hate that whitespace is significant in Python, as opposed to "curly bracket languages", where formating is entirely optional. Pythonistas
