This is intended as a side-by-side table of programming languages, organized by features. It is 
designed as an educational tool and as a fun project for me.

Please note that the table unavoidably contains my subjective opinions. I generally find that since
everyone is biased, it is more helpful to hear the honest opinion of someone who is open about their
biases, as opposed to someone pretending to be perfectly objective. This is the approach I have
taken - I have tried to be fair and soft-spoken, but if my characterization of your favorite or
least favorite language rubs you the wrong way, please open an issue, make a pull request, post an
angry video on the video-sharing platform of your choice, or get in touch with me in some other way.
